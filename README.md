# Caesars Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the **ROT13** cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. *Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.*

This is a function which takes a **ROT13** encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase.
